Three Pillars:
1. Fix the System.
2. House the Unhoused.
3. Restore Safety to the Streets.

[Reiterate the three pillars]
[Explain how they'll be addressed ("We will")]
... San Francisco's government has become inefficient and ineffective. For too long, city leaders have bickered and undercut each other. This is an emergency. SF is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, but for too long we've allowed untold suffering to occur on our streets.

Meet Dylan
[Blurb / Slogan "Dylan will fight to fix..."]

Intro
"Dylan is an innovator with experience..."

[What do I want to share with people about who I am]
Came from a middle class family, worked hard, got some lucky opportunities.
Mother is a social workerm, instilled values in me to give back to the community. Jewish traditions and culture placed importance on education and service to the community.
[Why am I doing this]
I've never thought of myself as a politician.
Realizing how lucky I am, how many opportunities I was given.
Have the responsibility to pay it forward.
